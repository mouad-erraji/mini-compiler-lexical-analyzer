# Mini Compiler - Lexical Analyzer

This is a simple lexical analyzer ("analyseur lexical") built in Python.  
It reads a mathematical or logical expression and breaks it down into tokens such as identifiers, numbers, operators, keywords, and punctuation.

## ‚ú® Features

- Recognizes identifiers, numbers, operators (arithmetic and logical), and punctuation.
- Constructs a symbol table with hash mapping.
- Handles basic error detection (unrecognized characters).
- Built with a finite state automaton and sparse matrix optimization.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- Python 2.7 (original development)
- Finite State Automata (FSA)
- Hash tables

---

## üìö How it works

- The input expression is read character by character.
- Each character is mapped to a transition column in the automaton.
- Final states correspond to valid lexical units.
- A symbol table is populated dynamically.
- Outputs tokens and their corresponding types.

## üì• How to run 

1. Run the `lexical_analyzer.py` script.
2. Enter any expression when prompted.
3. View the tokenized output and the final symbol table.

Example input:

```bash
Entrez votre expression = si a > 3 alors b = b + 1 finsi

Example output :

si         (Mot Cl√©)
a          (Identificateur)
>          (Operateur Logique)
3          (Nombre)
alors      (Mot Cl√©)
b          (Identificateur)
=          (Operateur Logique)
b          (Identificateur)
+          (Operateur Arithmetique)
1          (Nombre)
finsi      (Mot Cl√©)
